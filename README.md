# arduino-ESP8266-DHT22-MQTT
Demo on reading a temperature from a DHT22 sensor on a ESP8266 dev board and publishing and subcribing to a MQTT broker 

The following libraries have been used and are required:

- ESP8266 dev board environment (add via Arduino IDE board manager) : http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json

- MQTT library: https://github.com/256dpi/arduino-mqtt

- DHT library: DHT sensor library compatible with esp8266 board (use Arduino IDE library manager)  

Notes:

- A soldered header on the dev board is required.
- a pc/linux/macos station for programming using the Arduino IDE
- a breadboard/wires for prototyping
